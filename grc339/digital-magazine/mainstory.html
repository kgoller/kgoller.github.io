                            <h3>All time favorite Summer drinks</h3>
                    
                                <p>When it's summer, there's nothing better than a fruity, herby or frozen drink in hand! There’s a great variety of summer cocktails that play on the flavors of the season: sweet watermelon and juicy peaches, herbaceous mint and basil, and bright berries. Even better: icy summer drinks are the perfect way to beat the heat.</p>

                                <p>Here are all the best summer cocktails to try! We've got classics like the minty Mojito and the tangy margarita, and frozen drinks like daiquiris and pina coladas. There’s also gin and vodka cocktails, and fun fruity spins like watermelon cocktails and peach margaritas. Really: we want to drink them all.</p>

                                <h2>Classic Mojito</h2>

                                <p>Is there any cocktail more refreshing than a mojito? Of all the classic cocktails, this iconic Cuban drink is one of the greats. Here’s a mojito recipe that’s spot on perfection: not too sweet, bubbly, and minty fresh. Like the margarita, the true version has less sugar and more nuance than what it’s become in bars and pre-made mixes. It’s perfect for sipping on the patio, and just as good in the dead of winter when you’re dreaming of the beach. Here’s exactly how to make a simple mojito!</p>

                                <h2>Classic Piña Colada</h2>

                                <p>When it comes to frozen cocktails, the piña colada is iconic. It’s got those 1990’s chain restaurant vibes, and it’s hard to find a resort that doesn’t have on on the menu. But did you know it’s actually a classic cocktail invented in the 1950’s? Unfortunately many restaurant versions and bottled mixes stray from the essence of the real thing. What ingredients are really in this tropical frozen mixed drink?</p>

                                <h2>Vodka Spritzer</h2>

                                <p>Some days call for a classic cocktail, others for a funky and unique craft cocktail. Yet some others call for…a down home party drink. There’s no shame, and this one is 100% delicious. Try this bubbly and fruity Vodka Spritzer! It’s just sweet enough with a subtle berry flavor: tangy, refreshing and sparkling all at once. That’s cranberry juice that makes the brilliant red color, but it’s 100% juice so it’s tart and crisp instead of saccharine. It makes for the most satisfying party drink that you won’t want to end.</p>

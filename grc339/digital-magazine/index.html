                                    When it's summer, there's nothing better than a fruity, herby or frozen drink in hand! There’s a great variety of summer cocktails that play on the flavors of the season: sweet watermelon and juicy peaches, herbaceous mint and basil, and bright berries. Even better: icy summer drinks are the perfect way to beat the heat.

                                    A proper Aperol spritz tastes like summertime in Italy and looks like a golden orange sunset. I’ll gladly sip one on our front porch now, overlooking our overgrown front yard, and later, with a view of the Italian Riviera.

                                <p>
                                    The Aperol Spritz is an Italian aperitif, originally created in 1919 by bartender Raimondo Ricci. The drink was invented as a means to combat the heat and humidity of Italy’s summer months. It became popular among people who wanted something light to sip on before dinner.</p>
